This repository is home to the metadata that drives the provider and module registry for [OpenTofu](https://github.com/opentofu/opentofu)

It also contains the applications used to manage version bumping, validation and API generation of the registry that is hosted at [registry.opentofu.org](https://registry.opentofu.org).

**Thanks to Cloudflare for sponsoring a Business plan to host the registry on!**
